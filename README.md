# react-relay-app
A simple crud app I've built in order to get familiar with the Relay framework.
Uses react-relay-router for routing and mongodb as a db. Has working pagination with previous/next and optimistic updates for all operations.
Usage:
-------

```console
$ npm install
$ npm server
$ npm start
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
